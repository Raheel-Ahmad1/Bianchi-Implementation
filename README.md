The code snippet Calculates the delay and jitter of IEEE 802.11 WLAN basic scheme according to:     # G.Bianchi, "Performance analysis of the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function," in IEEE     # Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 535 - 547, March 2000.     # doi: 10.1109 / 49.840210.

It also plots the graph between probability vs number of backoff stages according to Markov chain model and probability vs average end to end packet delay.
